# ELSPETH — Agent Guide

ELSPETH (Extensible Layered Secure Pipeline Engine for Transformation and
Handling) is a pipeline engine for building, validating, running, and auditing
LLM/data workflows whose outputs must be reviewed, explained, and reproduced.
Two authoring surfaces — version-controlled YAML and the authenticated Web
Composer (an LLM tool loop) — target one runtime model: the same plugin
contracts, graph validation, executor, Landscape audit trail, and run
accounting. Validation and audit are part of the workflow, not after-the-fact
diagnostics.

## Quick reference

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate      # uv-managed venv (Python 3.12+)
pytest tests/                  # full suite; the plain default selection IS the CI-equivalent run
elspeth-lints check            # static-analysis / trust-tier lint gate
elspeth run --settings examples/<name>/settings.yaml --execute
```

## Gotchas

- Scoped test runs miss cross-cutting gates — run the full `pytest tests/`
  before merging.
- Worktrees live under `.claude/worktrees/<name>` and symlink `.venv` to the
  main checkout: a bare `uv pip install` inside a worktree clobbers the main
  venv.
- The pre-commit secret scanner rescans every line of a touched file, so old
  lines can fire on unrelated edits. Append `# secret-scan: allow-this-line`
  to a false positive; do not bypass the hook with `--no-verify`.
- `git stash` is blocked by a hook — use worktrees or commits instead.
- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` are untracked and machine-local: they do not
  exist inside fresh worktrees and edits to them are unversioned — back up
  before rewriting.
- Directory-scoped guides exist where the details live:
  `examples/AGENTS.md` (how to run every example) and
  `src/elspeth/plugins/transforms/AGENTS.md` (row data vs audit provenance).

## Project delivery posture

ELSPETH is pre-release software maintained by a single developer. Keep a
process, gate, or document only when it materially improves at least one of:

- reliability of code or tests;
- integrity of code, tests, data, audit evidence, or documentation; or
- supportability of code, deployments, operations, or user workflows.

Plans, run sheets, test procedures, runbooks, and incident diagnostics are
useful process documents and stay when they help build or operate the system.
Update or delete them normally as the system changes.

Do not create signed or sealed plan packages, plan hash manifests, review
receipt sidecars, approval chains, role handoffs, or equivalent organisational
ceremony for documents that will be updated or deleted. This does not prohibit
signatures, checksums, audit chains, or admission gates that protect actual
code, releases, exports, runtime data, or deployed artifacts. If removing a
practice is a marginal call or may discard a real safeguard, surface the tradeoff
to the developer before removing it.

## Filigree Issue Tracker

`filigree` tracks this project's work. Use it to find, claim, update and close
issues: `filigree session-context` at session start, then
`filigree start-next-work --assignee <name>`.

Full reference: the **filigree-workflow** skill (patterns, priorities,
observations, error codes), `filigree --help`, and the `mcp__filigree__*` tool
schemas. Prefer the MCP tools when available; fall back to the CLI.

Two rules `--help` will not tell you:

1. Claim atomically: `work_start` / `work_start_next` (MCP) or `start-work` /
   `start-next-work` (CLI). Never chain a claim with a separate status update;
   that two-step form races other agents.
2. On `SCHEMA_MISMATCH` the installed filigree is older than the project
   database. Surface it to the user; do not retry.

## Loomweave (code archaeology)

This repo is indexed by Loomweave: it has pre-extracted the tree into a
queryable map of entities (functions, classes, modules, files), the call /
reference / import edges plus relation edges (inherits_from / decorates /
implements / derives), and subsystem clusters. Before grepping the tree to
answer "what calls X", "what subclasses X", "where is X defined", "what
subsystem owns X", or "find the thing that does Y" — ask Loomweave's MCP tools
(`mcp__loomweave__*`): `entity_find`, `entity_at`, `entity_callers_list`,
`entity_relation_list`, `entity_neighborhood_get`, `project_status_get`.

`entity_find` is the grep replacement for "find the thing that does Y": it
matches a concept word by substring over name, summary, and docstring content
(e.g. `library` finds `LibraryService`), with no embeddings required — reach for
it before grepping. Semantic *ranking* is the separate, opt-in
`entity_semantic_search_list`.

Entity IDs are `{plugin}:{kind}:{qualified_name}`; subsystems are
`core:subsystem:{hash}`. Never hand-construct one: get it from `entity_find` /
`entity_at`, or — for a pasted qualname, Rust `::` path, or SEI token — from
`entity_resolve`, then copy it verbatim into the next tool.

Index freshness and counts: `project_status_get` (or the `loomweave://context`
resource). If the index is stale, run `loomweave analyze <path>`.

LLM summaries (`entity_summary_get`) are off by default and need a live
provider; `project_status_get` reports the posture, `loomweave config check`
explains enabling.

Full workflow: the `loomweave-workflow` skill.

## Warpline (temporal change-impact)

`warpline` is the Weft federation's temporal / change-impact authority — "if I
touch X, what breaks, and what must I re-verify?". Prefer the MCP tools
(`mcp__warpline__*`); fall back to the `warpline` CLI. Endorsed names and short
shims return identical schema+data.

- `warpline_change_list` / `changed` — changed entities for a rev range; call first.
- `warpline_impact_radius_get` / `blast_radius` — downstream affected set.
- `warpline_reverify_worklist_get` / `reverify` — worklist to recheck before done.
- `warpline_entity_timeline_get` / `timeline`, `warpline_entity_churn_count_get` /
  `churn`, `warpline_edge_snapshot_capture` / `capture_snapshot` (only mutating
  tool; writes `.weft/warpline/` only).

Enrich-only and local-only: every response is `meta.local_only: true`,
`peer_side_effects: []`. `enrichment` is a CLOSED vocab
(`present|absent|unavailable`); sibling absence is explicit, never an implied
clean/allowed state. warpline facts are advisory and never gate. See the
`warpline-workflow` skill for the full loop.

## Legis (git/CI + governance)

Legis is the git/CI and governance layer of the Weft suite: graded policy
enforcement over branch/commit/PR/check context, recorded in an append-only
audit trail keyed to stable code identity (SEI), so it survives rename/move.

Reach for it when a policy fires at the CI/git boundary, when a change needs a
recordable override or human sign-off, or when you need git/CI context.

- Prefer the `mcp__legis__*` MCP tools; fall back to the `legis` CLI.
- Clear a fired policy through `override_submit` (MCP-only), which grades it
  (self-clear / judged / escalated) and records it — routing around it leaves
  no trail.

Full reference: the `legis-workflow` skill, `legis --help`, MCP schemas.

<!-- wardline:instructions:v1:bcd19330 -->
<!-- wardline:last-writer:wardline install -->
This project uses **wardline** as its trust-boundary gate. Before handing back code that touches external input, run `wardline scan . --fail-on ERROR` (exit 0 = clean, 1 = gate tripped, 2 = wardline error) and fix findings at the boundary, not the sink. The full scan -> explain -> fix -> rescan loop and the baseline-vs-waiver discipline live in the `wardline-gate` skill and in `docs/agents.md`.

## Judge-signature stage (tier-model allowlist signing)

The `trust_tier.tier_model` lint allowlist seals each judge-gated suppression with an operator-held HMAC signature. Acquiring, repairing, or rotating those signatures runs across a two-actor seam: an agent **stages** a worklist key-free via the `elspeth-judge` MCP server (`mcp__elspeth-judge__*`: `stage_scan` / `stage_status` / `verify_signatures` / `stage_preview` / `stage_rekey`), and the **operator** fires it with the key via the `elspeth-lints` CLI (`sign-bundle` / `rekey`). **Staging asserts; firing verifies** — the operator step re-derives every binding from the live tree and aborts before any write on staleness. An agent must NEVER hold `ELSPETH_JUDGE_METADATA_HMAC_KEY` (the [O1] custody rule, elspeth-b3a3335c9f) and signing never runs in CI. Do not hand-edit a `judge_metadata_signature` or resurrect the old per-release signing runbooks — stage a bundle and have the operator fire it. All judging — including the final signature verdict — runs on the agentic harness with read-only tool access (`--judge-transport agent --judge-tools readonly`, 2026-07-09 policy): the judge explores the tree before ruling, and its rationale is secret-scrubbed before persist. The full workflow lives in the `judge-signature-workflow` skill and `docs/judge-signature-handoff.md`.
